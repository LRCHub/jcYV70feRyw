The French are glad to die for love
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girls best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you feed your pompus cat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Tiffany!
Cartie!
Cause we are living in a material world and I am a material girl
Ah come and get me boys ow!
Black star, rozz call talk to me harry siblez, tell me all about it!
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a
Heart-boiled employer thinks you're awful nice
Get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy when stakes are high
But beware when they start to descend
Ooh, diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best

Diamonds are a girls best friend

Lets make love
Yes! Yes! Tiger! Oh everything was going so well! (screams)
Cause that's when those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best, friend
