There was a silver tree
Down by a river wide
That's where we would go
To hang our pretty things
And watch the wind blow

There used to be a tree
Where we took our pretty things
We'd hook them by a thread
Golden egg, lipstick and feathers
Pieces of glass, chandelier baubles
And empty bottles of wine
And watch the light shine through

I'm afraid to forget you
I am remembering you
You were sparkling
